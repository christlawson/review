      <h2>1. A Brief History of Wine</h2>
      <p>Wine has been produced for more than 8,000 years, with the earliest known winemaking in Georgia (Eurasia). 
      The ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans refined viticulture and spread it across Europe. Today, wine is 
      an integral part of culture, gastronomy, and celebration worldwide.</p>

      <h2>2. Main Types of Wine</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Red Wine:</strong> Made with dark-skinned grapes, fermented with skins for color and tannins. 
        Popular varieties: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Syrah/Shiraz.</li>
        <li><strong>White Wine:</strong> Produced from green or yellow grapes. Typically lighter and crisp. 
        Examples: Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling.</li>
        <li><strong>Rosé:</strong> Pink wines, created by limited skin contact or blending reds with whites.</li>
        <li><strong>Sparkling Wine:</strong> Contains bubbles from natural fermentation or carbonation. Champagne, Prosecco, Cava are the most famous.</li>
        <li><strong>Dessert & Fortified Wines:</strong> Sweet wines often paired with desserts. Fortified wines like Port, Sherry, and Madeira have added spirits for higher alcohol.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. How Wine is Made</h2>
      <p>Winemaking (vinification) includes several key steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Harvesting:</strong> Grapes are picked by hand or machine.</li>
        <li><strong>Crushing & Pressing:</strong> Grapes are crushed to release juice. For red wines, skins are kept; for whites, they are usually removed.</li>
        <li><strong>Fermentation:</strong> Yeast converts grape sugar into alcohol. This can take days to weeks.</li>
        <li><strong>Aging:</strong> Wines may be aged in stainless steel, oak barrels, or bottles to develop flavors.</li>
        <li><strong>Bottling:</strong> The finished wine is filtered, stabilized, and bottled.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>4. How to Taste Wine Like a Pro</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Look:</strong> Hold the glass against a white background. Check color, clarity, and viscosity (the “legs”).</li>
        <li><strong>Swirl:</strong> Swirling aerates the wine, releasing aromas.</li>
        <li><strong>Smell:</strong> Inhale deeply. Detect fruit, floral, spice, or earthy notes.</li>
        <li><strong>Taste:</strong> Note sweetness, acidity, tannins, alcohol, and body.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish:</strong> High-quality wines have a long, pleasant aftertaste.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>5. Common Wine Terminology</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Body:</strong> The weight and mouthfeel (light, medium, full).</li>
        <li><strong>Tannins:</strong> Compounds from grape skins and seeds, giving dryness or bitterness.</li>
        <li><strong>Acidity:</strong> Gives freshness and crispness.</li>
        <li><strong>Dry:</strong> No perceptible sweetness.</li>
        <li><strong>Vintage:</strong> The year the grapes were harvested.</li>
        <li><strong>Terroir:</strong> The environment (soil, climate, region) that influences a wine’s character.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Storing & Serving Wine</h2>
      <p>Storage and serving greatly affect taste:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep wine bottles horizontally in a cool, dark place (10–15°C / 50–59°F).</li>
        <li>Avoid temperature fluctuations and direct sunlight.</li>
        <li>Red wines: Serve slightly below room temperature (16–18°C).</li>
        <li>White & Rosé: Serve chilled (8–12°C).</li>
        <li>Sparkling wines: Extra chilled (6–8°C).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Buying Wine as a Beginner</h2>
      <p>Don’t worry about price or labels — start exploring gradually:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Begin with approachable varieties: Pinot Noir (red), Sauvignon Blanc (white).</li>
        <li>Try wines from well-known regions: Bordeaux, Napa, Tuscany, Mendoza.</li>
        <li>Look for “Old World” wines (Europe) vs. “New World” wines (Americas, Australia) to compare styles.</li>
        <li>Visit local wine shops and ask for recommendations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Wine is a journey of discovery. The more you taste, the more your palate evolves. 
      Don’t stress about rules — the best wine is the one you enjoy. Cheers 🍷</p>
